          Hello! Welcome to Music Maven! This app is intended to help
          you hear the songs you want at a party or event. The host of
          the party will start a room, and guests at the party get to
          vote on which songs they like or don’t, and suggest songs that
          they want to hear! The host can then use their preferred music
          program to update the playlist of the party in real time. Giving
          the power back to the guests!

          When you opened the app, you saw this screen. Here, you should
          choose whether you are the host of the party or a guest. If you
          are the host, you will be the one looking at song requests and
          votes and implementing them in your playlist! If you are the
          guest, you are at a party where someone has already started
          hosting, and has a room code for you to sign in with and start voting.

        <p>
          If you are the host, when you click that button, your room code
          will appear as shown. It will be on the top of the pages for you
          to see at any time and tell your guests.

          If you are a guest, after you click guest, you will see a place
          for you to enter the room code. Get the room code from your host
          and enter it in the box!

          As the host, you will see a blank song list page. You can add songs
          that you plan to play, or songs that you want to get guest input on.
          Guests can also add song suggestions, and you will see them show up here.

        <p>
          As the host, you won’t be voting, but you can delete songs from the list.
          Swipe in either direction on the song to delete that song. If you see a
          duplicate or a song that has many down votes, you might decide you won’t
          play this one and delete it. With great power comes great responsibility.
          If you take your guests' input into consideration, you should have a
          successful playlist!

          As the host, you also have the ability to end the party. If you press the
          X in the top right corner, this will give you this pop up option to end the
          party, which will kick all the guests out, and delete your saved song list.
          Make sure that you are certain when you want to end the party!

          As a guest at this party, after signing in, you will see a song list page.
          This page may have songs in it already, or it may not. The host can add songs
          they want to play, and the guests can add song suggestions!

      </ion-row>
      <ion-row text-justify>
        <p>
          To add a song as a host or guest, click the green + button in the bottom right
          corner. This will bring up this Add Song page. This page allows you to type
          in the name of a song and the artist that you want to add to the song list!
        </p>
      </ion-row>
      <ion-row justify-content-center>

      </ion-row>
      <ion-row text-justify>
        <p>
          If you don’t know the artist, don’t worry about it! The song will still show
          up with an unknown artist, so the host can find it by the song name. Similarly,
          if you want to hear a particular artist, but you don’t care or know what song,
          you can just type in the artist, and hear any song by them! If you enter a random
          string of characters, or one that is ridiculously long, this will be considered
          invalid input, so put some real song names in there! This will be the best way to
          get your song suggestions seen, voted on, and played!
