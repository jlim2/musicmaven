              Hello! Welcome to Music Maven! This app is intended to help
              you hear the songs you want at a party or event. The host of
              the party will start a room, and guests at the party get to
              vote on which songs they like or don’t, and suggest songs that
              they want to hear! The host can then use their preferred music
              program (e.g. Spotify) to update the playlist of the party in
              real time. Giving the power back to the guests!

              When you opened the app, you saw this screen. Here, you should
              choose whether you are the host of the party or a guest. If you
              are the host, you will be the one looking at song requests and
              votes and implementing them in your playlist! If you are the
              guest, you are at a party where someone has already started
              hosting, and has a room code for you to sign in with and start voting.

              As the host, you will see a blank song list page. You can add songs
              that you plan to play, or songs that you want to get guest input on.
              Guests can also add song suggestions, and you will see them show up here.

              As the host, you won’t be voting, but you can add and delete songs from the list.
              Swipe either direction to delete a song. If you see a
              duplicate or a song that has many down votes, you might decide you won’t
              play this one and delete it. Please make sure to delete duplicate songs that have
              the identical song title and artist name (or it will cause an error).
              With great power comes great responsibility.
              If you take your guests' input into consideration, you should have a
              successful playlist!

              As the host, you also have the ability to end the party. If you press the
              X in the top right corner, this will give you this pop up option to end the
              party, which will kick all the guests out, and delete your saved song list.
              Make sure to tell your guests when you are ending the party so that they
              cannot add more songs.
              Make sure that you are certain when you want to end the party!

              Don't remember the song name or just want to listen to any songs by an artist?
              Not a problem! Just fill in one field.
              But not filling in any field or
              filling in ridiculously long or non-alphanumeric inputs will be considered
              invalid. So put some real song names in there! This will be the best way to
              get your song suggestions seen, voted on, and played!
